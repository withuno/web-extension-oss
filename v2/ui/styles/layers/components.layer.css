    Custom extensions to Tailwind's "components" layer can be added here.

    Typically, we don't require this feature for our application (because we use
    React). However, this flexibility is available to us should we find a reason
    to use it. For now, we leave this here in order to maintain a consistent
    pattern with the rest of our global CSS architecture.
